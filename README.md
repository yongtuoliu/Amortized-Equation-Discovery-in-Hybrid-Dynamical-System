## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ü¶Ñ Training and Validation

### 1. Training Data Preparation

Before training, please download the [datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19g7c1a2okoCd_OEt3D-l6nh27nXuNNAA?usp=sharing) and put them in [data](data/). The Mass-spring Hopping dataset has already been put in the folder, which is a good start.

### 2. Training and evaluating AMORE

```shell
python run-amore.py --config "./configs/spring-mass.yaml" --device "cuda:0"
```
